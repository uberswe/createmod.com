                                <p>CreateMod.com has undergone a full rewrite and is no longer running on Wordpress as it had been doing since 2022.</p>
                                <p>This website was created by Slaser360 and during June 2024 the ownership was handed over to Uberswe</p>
                                <p>Below is a list of changes that have been done since June.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Removed the majority of ads and all Google Adsense code</li>
                                    <li>Changed search to use in-memory <a href="https://blevesearch.com/">Bleve search</a></li>
                                    <li>Added ability to sort by ratings, views and more</li>
                                    <li>Complete redesign and new logo</li>
                                    <li>Removed lowest rated and most rated list from main page</li>
                                    <li>Added a trending list to the main page</li>
                                    <li>Fixed a bug allowing the same user to submit duplicate ratings once per day</li>
                                    <li>Cleaned up many bad schematics (will keep doing this)</li>
                                    <li>Compressed and optimized all images to reduce page size</li>
                                    <li>Made CreateMod.com open source, code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/uberswe/createmod.com">https://github.com/uberswe/createmod.com</a></li>
                                    <li>And so much more!</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The current site uses Go for the backend and mostly vanilla JS for the frontend. If you would like to help make the site better please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/uberswe/createmod.com">GitHub repository</a> and open an issue or a pull request.</p>
                                <p>I hope the CreateMod.com will be a better experience for everyone going forward and I believe there are many interesting features that could further improve the overall experience.</p>
                                <h3>Site Traffic</h3>
                                <p>Over time the site has received more and more popular and struggled with 100 concurrent users as I took it over. I spent a lot of time optimizing the old Wordpress site and ensuring that it has enough server capacity to serve traffic without crashes.</p>
                                <p>One issue was the incredible amount of data that is transferred from CreateMod.com every day. To help reduce the load I made use of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. Below you can see a recent graph of the traffic CreateMod.com receives.</p>

                                <p>Search bar has been fixed!!! (i hope)</p>

                                <p>I have changed the search system such that all post titles and tags are now indexed allowing for the search system to check all posts faster.</p>
                                <p>Previously the amount of posts was low and thus it was not an issue but as the amount of posts grew the time it took to search increased so much that some people reported being able to make whole sandwiches before it loaded. (I'm a Reuben guy personally).</p>

                                <p>Anyways, hopefully the search should report partials within a second or so and full searches as well.</p>

                                <p>More updates to come.</p>

                                <p>That's all for now, I apologize for the lag as none of the previously mentioned upcoming changes from the July announcement have been implemented yet.</p>
