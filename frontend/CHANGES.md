# Changes Made to Fix Frontend Issues

## 1. Fixed API URL Construction

The main issue was that API requests were failing with errors like:
```
API request error for http://localhost:8090/collections/schematic_categories/records?sort=name: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

This was happening because:
- The URL was missing the `/api/` prefix
- The URL construction was using string concatenation which can lead to malformed URLs

### Changes made:
- Updated `lib/api.js` to use the URL constructor for proper URL formatting
- Added proper handling for both server-side and client-side environments
- Ensured the `/api/` prefix is included in all API requests
- Added error handling for URL construction
- Added debugging output to log the constructed URLs

## 2. Created Test Page for API Connectivity

To verify that the API URL construction is working correctly:
- Created an API test page at `/api-test` that tests different API endpoints
- Added support for both server-side and client-side data fetching
- Included a dropdown to select which endpoint to test
- Added proper error handling and display of results

## 3. Fixed Stylesheet Loading

To address the stylesheet loading issues:
- Created a proper directory structure for static assets
- Copied necessary CSS files from the template directory to the frontend public directory
- Created a basic `_app.js` file that includes links to the stylesheets
- Added a global CSS file for basic styles

## 4. Created Basic Application Structure

To ensure the frontend has a solid foundation:
- Created a Layout component that provides a consistent page structure
- Created a simple index page as the entry point for the application
- Added proper metadata and favicon

## 5. Authentication Handling

The error "Only superusers can perform this action" suggests authentication issues:
- Added a note about authentication requirements in the API test page
- Included multiple test endpoints to identify which ones require authentication
- Set up the test page to handle authentication errors gracefully

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/server/main.go serve
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
4. Navigate to the API Test page to verify API connectivity
5. Check the browser console for API request URLs and any errors

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper authentication for API requests
2. Complete the frontend components for browsing and viewing schematics
3. Add user profile and settings pages
4. Implement schematic upload functionality
