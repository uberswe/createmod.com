# Main Page Update: Displaying Schematics

## Problem

The main page was showing a development status page instead of listing schematics. This was confusing for users who expected to see schematics on the main page.

## Solution

The main page has been updated to display recent schematics instead of the development status page. The welcome section has been kept, but the development status section has been replaced with a "Featured Schematics" section that displays the 6 most recent schematics.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated imports in index.js**:
   - Added import for SchematicCard component
   - Added import for getRecords function from the API library

2. **Modified the Home component**:
   - Updated component props to include schematics and totalItems
   - Kept the welcome section
   - Replaced the development status section with a "Featured Schematics" section
   - Added a grid layout for displaying schematics using the SchematicCard component
   - Added a fallback UI for when no schematics are found
   - Added a button to browse all schematics that shows the total count

3. **Updated getServerSideProps function**:
   - Added code to fetch schematics data using getRecords
   - Set parameters to fetch the 6 most recent, moderated, and non-deleted schematics
   - Included related data (author, categories, tags) for each schematic
   - Added the fetched schematics and totalItems to the props returned to the Home component
   - Updated error handling to return empty arrays for schematics and 0 for totalItems in case of an error

## Testing

The changes can be tested by:

1. Starting the backend server: `go run ./cmd/server/main.go serve`
2. Starting the Next.js development server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Opening http://localhost:3000 in a browser
4. Verifying that the main page displays schematics instead of the development status page
5. If there are no schematics available, verifying that the fallback UI is displayed correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Add filtering options to the main page to allow users to filter schematics by category, tag, etc.
2. Add a "Featured" flag to schematics and display featured schematics at the top
3. Add pagination to the main page to allow users to browse through more schematics
4. Add a "Most Popular" section that displays schematics with the most views or highest ratings
