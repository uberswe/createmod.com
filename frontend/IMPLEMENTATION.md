## Testing Recommendations

To ensure the implemented features work correctly, the following tests should be performed:

1. **Rating and Comments**
   - Test rating a schematic and verify the rating is saved
   - Test submitting comments and verify they appear after approval
   - Test error handling for invalid ratings or comments

2. **Related Schematics**
   - Verify "More from author" shows other schematics from the same author
   - Verify "Similar schematics" shows schematics with similar categories

3. **Upload Functionality**
   - Test uploading a schematic with all required fields
   - Test validation for required fields and file types
   - Verify the uploaded schematic appears on the site

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test the ErrorBoundary by intentionally causing errors
   - Verify loading states appear appropriately during data fetching
