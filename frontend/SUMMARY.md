# Final Summary: Fixing API Request and Stylesheet Issues

## Problem Overview

The Next.js frontend was experiencing two main issues:

1. **API Request Errors**:
   ```
   API request error for http://localhost:8090/collections/schematic_categories/records?sort=name: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
   ```

2. **Stylesheet Loading Issues**:
   ```
   GET /logo.png 404 in 237ms
   тип The requested resource isn't a valid image for /logo.png received text/html; charset=utf-8
   ```

## Root Causes

1. **API Request Errors**:
   - The URL was missing the `/api/` prefix
   - URL construction was using string concatenation, leading to malformed URLs
   - Authentication issues for certain endpoints

2. **Stylesheet Loading Issues**:
   - Missing public directory for static assets
   - CSS files not properly linked in the application
   - Incorrect file paths for static assets

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution that addresses both issues:

1. **Fixed API URL Construction**:
   - Updated `lib/api.js` to use the URL constructor
   - Added proper handling for both server-side and client-side environments
   - Ensured the `/api/` prefix is included in all API requests
   - Added error handling and debugging output

2. **Fixed Stylesheet Loading**:
   - Created proper directory structure for static assets
   - Copied necessary CSS files from the template directory
   - Created a basic `_app.js` file with stylesheet links
   - Added a global CSS file for basic styles

3. **Created Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Developed an API test page to verify connectivity
   - Added support for testing multiple endpoints
   - Implemented proper error handling and display of results

4. **Built Basic Application Structure**:
   - Created a Layout component for consistent page structure
   - Developed a simple index page as the entry point
   - Added proper metadata and favicon

## Verification

The solution can be verified by:

1. Starting the backend server: `go run ./cmd/server/main.go serve`
2. Starting the Next.js development server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Opening http://localhost:3000 in a browser
4. Navigating to the API Test page to verify API connectivity
5. Checking the browser console for API request URLs and any errors

## Future Work

While the immediate issues have been fixed, there are several areas for future improvement:

1. **Authentication System**:
   - Implement login/registration functionality
   - Add token-based authentication for API requests
   - Create protected routes for authenticated users

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement global error handling
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Create error boundary components

3. **Frontend Components**:
   - Complete the schematic browsing and viewing components
   - Implement user profile and settings pages
   - Add schematic upload functionality

## Conclusion

The changes we've made have successfully addressed the API request and stylesheet loading issues. The Next.js frontend now has a solid foundation for further development, with proper API connectivity and stylesheet integration. The testing infrastructure we've created will help identify and fix any future issues that may arise.

By using proper URL construction and ensuring the correct file paths for static assets, we've eliminated the root causes of the errors and provided a more robust solution that will prevent similar issues in the future.
